## Requirements

> Notes for AI: Keep it simple and clear.
> If the requirements are abstract, write concrete user stories

### Core Requirements

See [README.md](README.md)

### User stories

#### Adding memos
1. As a user, I want to get a list of memos extracted for a provided text so that I can review them.
2. As a user, I want to approve memos with one key press so they get added to the Second Brain immediately. After approving, I want to get the next memo for review.
3. As a user, I want to be able to restart the process at any time so that I can review the memos again. The process is restarted while keeping all approved memos and system instructions in the Second Brain.
4. As a user I want to provide feedback for a memo that I don't approve and get a revised memo along with revised system instruction memos for review.
5. As a user, I want to see the diff between the original and the revised memo so that I can understand the changes.

#### Retrieving memos
5. As a user, I want to get a combined text of memos based on a set of categories, and/or set of keywords, and/or similarity to a provided text so that I can get the relevant context.

#### Managing memos
6. As a user, I want to initiate a 'sleep' session and review the proposed changes one-by-one
7. As a user, I want to rebuild the vector store using the current memos, potentially with a different embedding model

## Flow Design

> Notes for AI:
> 1. Consider the design patterns of agent, map-reduce, rag, and workflow. Apply them if they fit.
> 2. Present a concise, high-level description of the workflow.

We'll start with the simplest design, where the LLM is given everything - memos, system instructions, and the text to generate context for and then LLM returns all memos in a single response.

The app then splits the reponse into separate memos based. Each memo will start with the 2-nd level header containing the path and the title, for example "## /Prompting tips/Use anyncronous tool calling". In this example, "Prompting tips" is the folder name, and "Use anyncronous tool calling" is the memo title. So a second-level header and presence of "/" is a clear indicator of the memo start.

The app then shows these memos to the user one-by-one, and asks for decision:
"Hit Enter to approve, enter comment to reject, or Ctrl-C or Ctrl-D to quit."

If the user wants to restart the process, they quit and just rerun the cli command again.

### Applicable Design Pattern:

1. Map the file summary into chunks, then reduce these chunks into a final summary.
2. Agentic file finder
   - *Context*: The entire summary of the file
   - *Action*: Find the file

### Flow high-level Design:

1. **First Node**: This node is for ...
2. **Second Node**: This node is for ...
3. **Third Node**: This node is for ...

## Data Models

```python
class Memo:
    title: str          # Memo title, used as filename
    category: str       # Category path
    body: str          # Memo content in markdown
    created_at: float  # Unix timestamp
    updated_at: float  # Unix timestamp

class Feedback:
    memo_path: str
    comment: str
```

       - Retrieves memo content
       - Returns None if memo doesn't exist

### Implementation Notes:
- All utilities implement proper error handling and logging
- I/O operations use async where appropriate
- All functions include type hints and unit tests
- Each utility follows single responsibility principle

## Node Design

### Shared Memory

> Notes for AI: Try to minimize data redundancy

The shared memory structure is organized as follows:

```python
shared = {
    "key": "value"
}
```

### Node Steps

> Notes for AI: Carefully decide whether to use Batch/Async Node/Flow.

1. First Node
  - *Purpose*: Provide a short explanation of the nodeâ€™s function
  - *Type*: Decide between Regular, Batch, or Async
  - *Steps*:
    - *prep*: Read "key" from the shared store
    - *exec*: Call the utility function
    - *post*: Write "key" to the shared store

2. Second Node
